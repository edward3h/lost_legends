If you want to suggest a unit to add, open an issue, or edit the file yourself and send me a pull request. 
The only rule is the unit must have had an official model at some point in 40k history, and isn't easily represented by an existing codex entry.
(Also I'm not interested in including units which have current Horus Heresy rules)
